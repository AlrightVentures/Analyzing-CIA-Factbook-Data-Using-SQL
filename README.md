# Analyzing-CIA-Factbook-Data-Using-SQL

In this project I work with data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like:

- population - The population as of 2015.
- population_growth - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
- area - The total land and water area.

I use SQL in Jupyter Notebook to explore and analyze data from this database to identify densely populated countries.
